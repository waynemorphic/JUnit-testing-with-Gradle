# JUnit-testing-with-Gradle
- In these Java programs, I have used Test Driven Development and Behavioural Driven Development principles to develop: 
  1. Ping pong game that replaces numbers divisible by 3, 5 and 15 with either Ping, Pong or Ping Pong depending on where the number appears. 
  2. Shape boolean program that prompts users to enter values of a rectangle's length and width. The user then sees whether these values would create a rectangle or a square.

  3. TwoSum algorithm where the sum of two elements in an array computes to the given target.

  3. Print numbers in an array from 1 to number entered by user. If a number is negative, print `[1]`. This program is then followed by the Ping pong program

## Goal
1. Implementing BDD 
2. Understanding the architecture of JUnit framework (Platform, Jupiter and API)
3. Using Gradle as a build and test automation tool

## Next
Planning to explore BDD and JUnit further using: 
1. A palindrome algorithm 
2. Bubble sorting algorithm
