# JUnit-testing-with-Gradle
- In these Java programs, I have used Test Driven Development and Behavioural Driven Development principles to develop: 
  1. Ping pong game that replaces numbers divisible by 3, 5 and 15 with either Ping, Pong or Ping Pong depending on where the number appears. 
  2. Shape boolean program that prompts users to enter values of a rectangle's length and width. The user then sees whether these values would create a rectangle or a square.

## Goal
1. Implementing BDD 
2. Understanding the architecture of JUnit framework (Platform, Jupiter and API)
3. Using Gradle as a build and test atomation tool

## Next
Planning to explore BDD and JUnit further using:
1. Two sum and three sum algorithm
2. A palindrome algorithm 
3. Bubble sorting algorithm
